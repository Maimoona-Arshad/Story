"The universe is transformation; our life is what our thoughts make it."
                                                             - Marcus Aurelius
"No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit."
                                                                                                                             - Helen Keller
